## Introduction

Code to perform Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM), a principal components analysis (PCA)-based spatial covariance method.

Spatial covariance patterns are derived as PCA eigenvectors reflecting significant sources of variance in the data. These patterns are also called Group Invariant Subprofiles - GISs.

They can represent:
- neuroanatomical/functional brain networks - interconected brain regions
- involvement of brain regions in a given clinical/neuropathological condition


## Installation

The package is available on PyPI. You can install it with:

```bash
pip install ssm-pca
```

## Usage

Using the Command Line:
```bash
python -m ssm_pca --csv_file "data.csv" --mask_file "brain_mask.nii" --save_dir "results/" --image_shape "(91,109,91)" --preprocess_img True

```
